negative	boring plot not funny everything went wrong
negative	terrible movie
negative	way too much whoopi !
negative	whoopie - painful as always .
negative	sad , i actually do like adam sandler . he is a decent comedian , but he can't act . and what is it with his films ? they just don't seem to have any signs of a cohesive plot to them .
negative	adam sandler shows once again he can't act in this travesty that has him using profanity around little children and knocking mcdonalds . most humor is quite sick and this movie is horrid . don't even take a bribe to see it !
negative	frankly , the moon is where i'd like both kaufman and carrey to go . and stay .
negative	it wasn't that funny or interesting .
negative	proving jim carrey and drama do not mix .
negative	jim carrey can't act . jim carrey is not funny . as soon as the public at large realizes that the better off we'll all be .
negative	the image of andy kaufman as a nice , funny guy is shattered by reality . he is a mean , twisted , manipulative individual . the movie is marketed like it is a comedy and this is far from the truth . the reality of andy kaufman's life was not all fun and games and this movie is his life story , but it is sold ( like kaufman ) to the public as something it is not .
negative	this was one of the only movies i have ever walked out of . it is the worst thing i have seen in a long , long time . the theatre we saw it in accidentally played one of the reels upside down and backwards . that was the only time we laughed . we were lucky though , because we saw it at the cheap theatre and it only cost us $ 1 . 50 each . of course , we still felt ripped off .
negative	i thought the stale nachos from the theater concession were the best part of this movie . it was a long drawn out film that never took the time to really develop any of the characters -- not even andy . and courtney love the actor -- someone please get me another stale snack !
negative	this is the most unfunny , makes no sense movie i have ever seen .
negative	kirsten dunst sucks .
negative	worst movie in the world . . . cheerleaders suck ! !
negative	stupid
negative	kirsten dunst , your 15 minutes are just about up . . .
negative	why is it that movies set at high school nowadays have to be sick . besides the attractive female cheerleaders and a few eccentric cameos , the movie stinks . they combine very sick gags , profanity , disrespectful attitudes , fights and obscene gestures . easily one of the worst movies i've ever seen .
negative	pathetic . goes to show how shallow the world is nowadays .
negative	no way ! i fell asleep about 5 minutes into it .
negative	i gave this movie a one because it was horrible . it was just about cheerleading , and i'm a guy . i need action .
negative	they should have called it stupid if not for alica silverstone it would have been a complete waste of time .
negative	'clueless' . . . how appropriate . . . seems the producers knew it from the beginning . . . any you airheads rating this movie great : of 10 million sperm , you were the faster ? ? ? ?
negative	this was just another dumb blow it up movie . willis is a better actor than this and would have to wait many years to show it .
negative	i think a brilliant performance by hopkins is utterly wasted in this scurrilous piece of trash .
negative	just because there are babes in it doesn't make it good . this was a true piece of sh * t from beginning to end . . .
negative	my husband and best friend dragged me out to this movie , thinking that this was all about t & a , but it was something worse--it was a thinly-veiled chick flick ! ( though , it was kinda amusing to see their reactions after the movie , it made it almost worth sitting through it ) . it's one of those little girl in a big town trying to make it on her own kind of movies , and if you like that kind of thing , then go for it . i'll pass , though .
negative	sucked !
negative	dont waste your money on it and if you are at someones home who owns it and suggests to watch it , dont even waste your time ! !
negative	just because a movie has hotties doesn't automatically make it good--case in point .
negative	ugly is right . don't get me wrong , the women are attractive , but it's just a dull movie that doesn't know comedy . take a tip from frasier , the emperor's new groove , or kung pow and then we'll talk .
negative	wait a minute . . . . this is supposed to be a comedy ? i didn't laugh a single time throughout this movie . in fact , i don't think any of the others i was with did either . the actual film it took to make this movie would have been better spent taping me scratch myself . who produces this kind of trash ?
negative	this movie was horrible . nothing new in this movie , same old girl in the big city . only thing worth praise were the advertisements .
negative	i don't think i've ever been as nauseated in my entire life as i was during the scene when what's-her-name was jamming on the roof to the beat of the neighbor's music . this movie was long and painful , mostly because of the insipid main character . i like to think that most girls don't identify with this kind of thing .
negative	pointless feminine crap .
negative	coyote ugly has no plot . the storyline is as skimpy as the costumes the women at the bar wear . it's a poor attempt at a remake of flashdance and its major audience seems to be lonely lonely teenage boys with no access to porn .
negative	this movie was portrayed on the commercials as a movie guys want to see , with lots of hot chicks and even more drinking . it turned out to be a chick flick about a songwriter's dream of making it big and not about a bar . don't see this movie .
negative	i'm here to set things straight on rateitall . com once and for all . this is to be my first opinion . here i go : bringing down the house , does not necessarily tell a story which is outdated , but rather one which should embarass humanity into making its reddest face and its most solemn look of all . let's look at the issues tackled in this film , set in 2003 : 1 ) slavery , 2 ) black ( and white ) stereotypes , and 3 ) cultural appropriation . slavery officially ended over 100 years ago , ( to those born more recently , right after gettysburg and gods and generals took place ) , but as we can obviously see in our day to day experience , racism is still rampant , be it in the white dominated media , the movies , or in general conversation and confrontation . what is baffling to me is why this film should combine an early 1800s attitude towards blacks with our current sensibilities in such an artless and tasteless manner . steve martin's character and his family can't be seen in public with latifah ? she has to pose as their nanny to be accepted socially ? . . . i can't even finish . the fact that this movie was a success theatrically just shows how ignorant we are as a culture . what a sloppy and hopeless pile of poo this movie was . ( note : despite these issues i have brought up briefly , i have to say that this film began with the most boring internet scene of all time . any filmmaker who thinks that filming a computer being used for instant messaging is a good way to engage viewers is stoned . )
negative	to call the characterzations in this movie stereotypes would be an insult to stereotypes . thirty years ago this movie would have been out of date . martin and latifah should be ashamed of themselves to get involved with such a stupid depiction of blacks and whites . the really offensive thing about this movie is that its supposed to be some sort of social commentary .
negative	the parts that weren't downright stupid were downright nauseating . a waste of jim carrey's talent .
negative	i'd have root canal work done without anesthetic before i'd see this again .
negative	terrible movie , i hated it and can't believe they made a second one . jim carrey is loud , obnoxious and not funny , more on the side of exaggerated and gross . i don't like movies that insult my intelligence .
negative	this movie is surprising bad . jack nickelson is a good actor , but even his acting could not save this piece of junk . kathy bates , a fine actress , is the only other bright spot in this otherwise dull and unwitty clunker . i did like the monolouge narration of nickelson for his adopted son , but over-all , i was very disappointed with this movie .
negative	about schmidt easily qualifies for my list of the ten worst movies i've ever seen . its incredibly slow pace , depressing tone , and pathetic attempt to convey something deep made it extremely unpleasant and annoying to watch . the plot goes nowhere , and i couldn't find anything compelling about the characters . i'm surprised to note that this is the first time i haven't been impressed by jack nicholson and kathy bates . there's simply not a single reason to watch this movie .
negative	what's the point here ? the story went nowhere , he ended up where he started , he failed in his quest and he can look forward to a lonely life with idiot in-laws . plus , the movie was just plain boring ( seeing kathy bates naked didn't help , either ) . real inspiring . . . . .
negative	i rarely hate movies , but this one was awful ! the plot was stupid and the ending was really bad . adam sandler is very funny when he plays crazy people , but in this movie he played the straight man to jack nicholson . adam sandler just can't play normal !
negative	i hate it . you think it's funny , while it's not . it's not good funny , it is sick funny , and it kinda freaks me out and i hate the stupid movie . it can die .
negative	working girl has got to be the worst harrison ford movie ever made . the movie is like listening to girl talk for 2 straight hours . it's like the designing women movie . the plot is simple : sigourney weaver is a mean and greedy boss of a man and a woman , and the woman is griffith in her mindless role .
negative	never even consider renting this movie - it's terrible . harrison ford made a rare mistake and agreed to work with a terrible script and one of the most annoying actresses ever ( melanie griffith ) . actually , now that i think about it , he made the same mistake with 6 days , 7 nights . anyway , this movie is a joke and isn't even worth tearing apart .
negative	worst movie ever . are you kidding me ?
negative	not funny
negative	finally a movie that shows mel gibson's arrogance in complete clarity . his ego maniac persona shined thruout this whole movie without ever taking a break . he has no talent , is very unattractive , and couldn't act his way out of a paper bag . if you can actually look around mel's inflated head at the movie itself , it will just make you fall asleep , as it lacks all forms of entertainment needed in any type of movie . . . a movie that should be missed and i would never recommend it . . . don't waste your money . . .
negative	i can t tell you what most women want because to be frank i don t give a flying fig . but speaking as a woman , i could have done without this farce . considering his past success in the lethal weapon films , i will say that i feel mel gibson has more than proven he can be halfway decent at madcap , insane comedy . however , he needs to realize that his ability to act nuts-o extremely well does not a leading man in light romantic comedy make . this movie made it glaringly apparent that he was never meant to follow in the footsteps of fred astaire , cary grant , or gene kelly . he is , for the most part , an action figure with acting ability who has managed to make some admirable hits within a sea of okay films . if what he has done best so far in his career can be compared to bygone film styles i would say that his forte has been the sweeping epic ( braveheart , the patriot ) . what women want was almost painful to watch as he clumped his way through this silly , clumsily written game of gender self awareness . helen hunt on the other hand after years in fluffy tv sitcom and an acting range that apparently exceeds gibson s by about 50 % seemed more up to the job . but even she couldn t save this pathetic ship full of holes ( a few of her lines were actually embarrassingly stupid ) . not even semi-funny cameos by the likes of bette midler were of much help to this albatross . after forcing myself to stay awake i flipped off the recorder once again thankful i had rented the dvd rather than having paid theater admission and even more glad that i d gotten a special discount rate for signing up with a new video store . don t waste your time unless you re a major gibson fan it may be the only way you won t notice the smell .
negative	this movie was not funny it actually sucked .
negative	trash . this type of stuff is what rots away the moral fiber of our youth . trust me . it makes the partying stupid guy who doesn't take college seriously look like a king and the kid who actually listens to his parents look like a huge geek . i didn't like it at all .
negative	tom green is a cancer . . .
negative	i detest tom green ( the most unfunny man in north america ) . the black fraternity scenes were too heavily borrowed .
negative	road trip is an extremly unfunny and stupid comedy starring tom green who is a college teacher and tell his students about his days in college and what happened .
negative	road trip is pure trash . it is so sad that people feel they must constantly resort to this kind of toilet humor in order to get a laugh . a bunch of sorry actors who want to be comedians .
negative	this movie was horrible ! it was not on the same level as there's something about mary . the movie did have some funny moments and would have been much better without tom green . he was stupid and brought down the movie . the black fraternity scene was pretty amusing .
negative	i'd rather watch 90 minutes of previews .
negative	wow . people actually liked this movie ? amazing !
negative	thi is the worst movie i have ever seen ! ? they should burn that movie to pieces ! i think that was a crappy movie !
negative	pointless child-like craziness . i could never even begin to imagine that this would ever happen off the silver screen .
negative	a stupid story . . . . . no laughs for me .
negative	i'm probably being harsher on this movie than i should because it's hard to reconcile its amazing popularity with the fact that it stinks , especially if you get sick of physical , cartoon-like comedy after the first person slips on something and falls down the stairs . and it's not chevy chase making the fall .
negative	home alone . . . are you kidding ? mcauley , how's your wife ?
negative	you've got a baby ? in a bar ? ? ? you've got reese witherspoon ? in a movie ? ? ?
positive	perhaps the perfect action thriller movie . funny , suspenseful , dramatic , action packed . has it all .
positive	a well constructed thriller .
positive	my favorite action movie yet !
positive	i love this movie ! i bought it on dvd when it came out . it's better than the original , and jamie lee and lindsey were great .
positive	funny funny funny
positive	really funny
positive	the first time i saw this was in a huge . packed cinema with surround sound etc . . i left feeling exhausted , as if i had actually been involved in the scenario . excellent , and you can watch it over and over again .
positive	funny movie all around . it's kinda weird to see professor mcgonagall from the harry potter flicks as a nun ! great musical interpetation of my guy by the nun's choir . rather than making fun of religion , i think it shows that religion can be a fun thing , and there is nothing wrong with that ! !
positive	on e of the best movies that whoopi made !
positive	hysterical . the idea of whoopi goldberg as a nun is funny enough . with the soundtrack and the dialogue in this movie , it's flat hysterical . excellent movie .
positive	this is the venue whoopi needs to stick too . acting .
positive	the greatest action movie ever made .
positive	this is an excellent movie , it still makes me laugh to this day . i highly recommend this movie for the whole family . most of whoopi's earlier work was so awesome . i highly recommend sister act 2 as well . i wish they would come out with part 3 , too !
positive	i nearly peed my pants ! it is so funny . whoope goldberg is a gem .
positive	whoopi goldberg can be funny at times , but she's so often in films that don't fit with her style . sister act was the perfect film for her , a vegas lounge singer hiding from the mob in a convent . predictably , she turns the lives of the nuns upside down , and they , in effect , have a big influence on her . the personalities of the show's stars--whoopi , harvey keitel , mary wickes , kathy najimy , and maggie smith--are so winning , you overlook some of the obvious cliches .
positive	i loved this movie . i've watched it again and again and laugh every time . the sequel ruined the series . goldberg plays the role of sister mary clarence superbly .
positive	this movie is another comedy classic . whoopi goldberg becomes a nun in this funny movie . the movie doesn't plod too much and the humor is present , especially in the church scenes . highly recommended ! a nod to the flying nun would have made it even better !
positive	very well done from every angle . a tough action film to beat .
positive	i really like this movie . you're right on , more songs less arguing . the songs are brilliant and the movie is really funny . andrea robinson , the singing voice for wendy makkena's character sounds like an angel on hail holy queen . i love this movie !
positive	sister act left you wanting more . the movie needs more songs , less arguing .
positive	whoopi goldberg was really good . very good singing . whoopi working with bad kids , helping them change their ways .
positive	adorable and hilarious .
positive	hilarous and funny kick ace movie love it !
positive	great film , alan rickman is one of my favorite things about this film .
positive	one of adam's best . those kids playing frankenstein were great . do you want to put on a hooters shirt for old times sake ? whats he talking about mommy ?
positive	it funny and sweet , and all round good movie
positive	i loved this movie ! the action is great , and i like how bruce willis gets his butt kicked throughout the movie ( unlike other i-can-kick-high-so-bullets-can't-hurt-me action movies . ) alan rickman plays a great villain . even though the movie is totally dated now , it's still fun brain candy !
positive	this movie is hallirous ! the little boy is dang cute ! it has something for everyones taste ! if you have not seen it yet i suggest that you go down to blockbuster right now and rent it , you will luv it ! !
positive	a good comedy should be hilarious of course , but it should also tell a story that alters the main character in some way , as well as touches and engages the viewer . big daddy has it all , and adam sandler was flawless and brilliant ! ! ! a must-see ! ! !
positive	i love adam sandler , especially in this movie . he looks like he would be a great daddy , too bad i can't play the mommy . : )
positive	this is one of my favourite movies . it's really funny and it's sweet too . adam sandler does a great job and the little boy in the movie is really cute . this movie is definitely worth seeing .
positive	so u agree . . . u think you're really pretty ?
positive	amazing movie , shame it didnt have a few of the trailer clips in it , which i was suprised at . but really funny and makes you think . not too fussed on lyndsey lohan bt i liked her in this . ace ! !
positive	a genius movie . my favorite of all time with perhaps a few disney classics as exceptions . tina fey is genius as a writer .
positive	a blast ! bought the dvd set . great comic book escapism . alan rickman was terrific .
positive	along with lethal weapon , die hard easily makes my list of the top action films of the lasy 20 years . it's your typical shoot em' up flick with willis playing the macho cop john mcclane , who must face off terrorists in an office building 3 , 000 miles out of his jurisdiction . solid performances by willis and reginald veljohnson are the film's high points , but the biggest props have to go to alan rickman , a relatively unknown actor who played the role of hans gruber very convincingly . overall , die hard is the film to watch if you're looking for some good action mixed with a little bit of comedy .
positive	great film and carey proves he can act when he wants to prove it but i don't think it belongs in the comedy category .
positive	classic action-film . i just saw it for the 4th or 5th time . couldn't change the channel . the bad guy was just as good as , if not better than , bruce willis .
positive	great movie jenna elfman rules
positive	jenna elfman rules
positive	a fantastic movie ; side splittingly funny at times , romantic , poignant . it plays on the rabbi / priest stereotypes with humour but sensitivity . the happy ending is of course not unexpected but the film sets out to end on a happy note , friendship prevails . a strong directing debut from edward norton , one of the most talented actors around today , and he , jenna elfman and ben stiller are all very believable in their roles . a great movie .
positive	this movie was great ! ! i can't think of anything bad to say about this movie . the cast was great , the acting was great . i just love ben stiller and edward norton . jenna elfman is just breath-taking ! ! !
positive	extremely funny . great acting , great script . i work in a video store and everyone loved it .
positive	very funny , especially norton , wallach and forman !
positive	by far the best of the hannibal trilogy of movies . anthony hopkins , jodie foster and the entire cast work so well together . this movie did the book justice . creepy , sadistic , thrilling . a classic !
positive	innocent people were held hostage in a high rise building , and bruce willis saves the day . the storyline was easy to follow . the action was top notch even though the movie was made way back . it has lots of good gun fights similar to john woo films , and bruce willis had the tough guy sort of look throughout the whole movie , he was perfect for the role . i would agree that this original one is the best of the trilogy .
positive	edward norton is so hugable and cute ! ! ! ! i love that guy . what a babe !
positive	wow i would actually want to be friends with these characters , and i very seldom find that to be true with this kind of movie .
positive	great movie ! very funny and a unique topic . not stupid funny the way a lot of movies are trying to be . quality humor .
positive	this movie was hilarious . the actors worked well together and fit their parts .
positive	wonderful . i loved the extension and development of the priest / rabbi jokes . great acting from edward norton , ben stiller , and jenna elfman .
positive	this movie was the best of all the die hards . . an amazin trilogy it has been . . hopefully they make the fourth one . . bruce willis is amazin . . . all the explosions in this movie were truly amazin . . the dialogue was good even tho most of it was only abuses . . this movie proves one thing . . bruce willis is the god of action movies
positive	jenna elfman , ben stiller , and edward norton do justice to one of the oldest jokes around . a priest and a rabbi walk into a . . . this is a movie that all will enjoy , and if you grew up in a jewish or catholic religion you'll have a better appreciation of where you come from , that , and you'll be laughing your butt off !
positive	this movie was great . the movie was about three people who were best friends when they were younger . one became a priest , one a rabbi , and the girl fell in love with one of them at the same time when the other guy fell in love with her . a love triangle formed between the three characters .
positive	i love this movie !
positive	great competitive movie with a sense of humor that was also emotionally tear jerking at the end , but it ended well . i would go see it again .
positive	very much a good movie . shows they way that cheerleaders work . lots of hotties .
positive	packed full of action . being a dancer , it was very exciting to me . i like watching cheerleading competitions .
positive	the movie had an interesting plot about how they were always winning and ended up losing to the rival . the movie has a good ending .
positive	i think this movie was great from its success in combining comedy and a real life case . it had all sorts of high school guys getting together in a challenging teamwork to make a dream come true . from one side , it had many funny situations and from the other , it made you feel what the challenge means and lets you hit with the muzik ! ! !
positive	a genre defining film with a lead character that was tough but vulnerable . i still watch this film on a regular basis as it became the action picture by which most others are compared . willis was perfectly cast for this role and rickman gives a fantastic performance .
positive	luved it yeah baby ! ! to see kirsten d in a yummy cl uniform wow ! ! that my feinds is film making ! ! the only dumb point was to make it a race issue with 'those black chix' who were always in a sour combative mood , who cares who steals dance moves ? ? ? i went to see kirsten d jump around and wow did she deliver ! ! the other girl was a major cupcake also mmmmmmmmm but her dufus brother playing air gee-tar was lame . -----todd michael wiseman ohio univ college of film cinematography
positive	bring it on is a great movie , especially for young people . it's about cheerleaders , teenagers , etc . i think that it's a great movie and is worth the money spent . i'm willing to buy that movie when it comes out .
positive	exellent its one of the best action films of all time dynomite
positive	bring it on starts with no storyline but the story picks up . the dancing is awesome and i enjoyed the drama .
positive	a classic shoot-em-up , kill-the-bad-guys movie that should rank up there with dirty harry . it ranks # 146 out of 250 films of all time on imdb . com -- the comedic one liners are skillfully written into a predominately violent movie . this was also a make-or-break movie for bruce willis to see if he could break out of the moonlighting tv show mold . he did it flawlessly and became an a-list actor .
positive	thosee girls where so hot . the movie was funny also .
positive	i think it is a totally awesome movie ! alicia is great and i hav 2 give snaps 2 stacy an donald they were so funnyyo whats up u jeepin behind my back ? ha
positive	i don't care how lame , or stupid some people think this movie is , it still has a great story line and it is definately a feel good coming of age movie . it wasn't filled with garbage or too much sex . a perfect teen movie that if i had teenagers of my own , i would definately recommend this movie to them . alicia silverstone is a talented actress who will go far if she keeps her talent pointed in the right direction .
positive	if you don't like this movie , you might be a german mercenary . one of the greatest bang for your buck action movies ever made . it's filled with non-stop explosions , gunfire , and an occasional laugh or two . yippie kye yi yeah ! ! ! !
