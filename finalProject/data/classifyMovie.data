the image of andy kaufman as a nice , funny guy is shattered by reality . he is a mean , twisted , manipulative individual . the movie is marketed like it is a comedy and this is far from the truth . the reality of andy kaufman's life was not all fun and games and this movie is his life story , but it is sold ( like kaufman ) to the public as something it is not .
this was one of the only movies i have ever walked out of . it is the worst thing i have seen in a long , long time . the theatre we saw it in accidentally played one of the reels upside down and backwards . that was the only time we laughed . we were lucky though , because we saw it at the cheap theatre and it only cost us $ 1 . 50 each . of course , we still felt ripped off .
i thought the stale nachos from the theater concession were the best part of this movie . it was a long drawn out film that never took the time to really develop any of the characters -- not even andy . and courtney love the actor -- someone please get me another stale snack !
this is the most unfunny , makes no sense movie i have ever seen .
kirsten dunst sucks .
worst movie in the world . . . cheerleaders suck ! !
stupid
kirsten dunst , your 15 minutes are just about up . . .
why is it that movies set at high school nowadays have to be sick . besides the attractive female cheerleaders and a few eccentric cameos , the movie stinks . they combine very sick gags , profanity , disrespectful attitudes , fights and obscene gestures . easily one of the worst movies i've ever seen .
pathetic . goes to show how shallow the world is nowadays .
terrific movie and different from everything else in its genre . i loved every minute
i totally enjoyed this film . i thought that it was in fact a really good representation of the kind of ennui that some of us felt after highschool . i think it also speaks about kids today , the post modern sense of fashion , in trying to create a look of your own and to build ideas of your own from what has gone before that is really important in looking at why society is forming the way it is . i didn't think the film came across as too biased in favor of the characters , they were often made to look rediculous . this film reminded me of the sense of confusion that we often feel as we form our identities thoughout our lives . it also mocked the collector and i think you could read social commentary in that as well . we live in such an affluent society that we can collect things , most of us don't have to worry about day to day survival , we can amass luxury items and keep them on shelves forever expanding and we can even build our identities around them as well . i read a lot into this film and i think there was a lot of meat to grab on to , lots to think about and to talk about . that to me is the mark of a really good film .
a truly solid movie - great plot - deep , funny and well made . i like the sci-fi , thriller , drama - guy movies . however- this was such a well made movie- it goes on the top 20 list . keeps you intereste regardless - whether you go with your friends or date - great !
very good film . i had been anticipating this picture heavily ever since i had fallen in love with thora birch in american beauty . i was not dissapointed with this movie which is based off a sorely under appriciated graphic novel of the same title . this movie takes place following the graduation of two teenage girls who have always planned on moving in together and being forever friends . their pleasure is scrutinizing and making fun of strangers . one day they are reading the personals and come across one that a man has placed seeking a woman he met on a plane ride . the two girls find this utterly pathetic and deside to call him , pretending to be the woman , set a date , and then go watch him as the date never shows up . thora's character then becomes curious about the man ( steve buscimi ) and slowly grows attached as her best friend slowly grows away from her . thora is in top form in this bitter comedy . she has mastered the bitter girl and i can't wait to see her in her next film . simplistic in form and mature in subject . very good movie . highly recommended .
very funny , very smart . i love the ironic satire and unpredictable situations . steve bushemi is awsome ( one of my favorite actors ) as well as the rest of the cast . very well directed . a must see !
a diffrent teenage movie a good story about after high school and what to do now it had the dark hair girl from american beauty and the great steve buseim .
excellent . also preety origional . not many movies are about people who hang out at a mall . it was funny watching silent bob try to use jedi powers . also the stink pawm . i should gag someone with that someday . well here and there this movie has its legendary moments .
can you say excellent ? this movie was so hilarious . a definate classic in the arena of comedy movies . jason lee and shannen doughtery were wonderful in this movie . kevin smith is just totally awesome .
kevin smith does it again with mallrats . this movie is insanely hilarious . jason lee and jeremy london both play incredibly funny characters , and the dialogue between the two , although lacking any amount of intelligence , is comic genius .
