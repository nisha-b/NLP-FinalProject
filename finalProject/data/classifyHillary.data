Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch..
Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS bad trade deals broken borders police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great.
Funny if you listen to name the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two they are fawning. What a difference.
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. ll of that work energy and money and nothing to show for it! Waste of time..
Elizabeth Warren often referred to as Pocahontas just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary who she always hated!.
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs..
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself..
I was at name and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!.
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time energy and money. The V.P. a joke!.
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers..

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in B never had a chance!. Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught that's all! They laughed at Bernie..
If Bernie Sanders after seeing the just released e-mails continues to look exhausted and done then his legacy will never be the same..
Thank you! hashtag url.
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!.
How much BD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails using even religion against Bernie!.
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails which should never have been written (stupid) because Putin likes me.
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix merica's problems. ISIS &amp; all others laughing!.
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good but for the final night my speech great. Thank you!.
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory she's out!.
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well!.
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!.
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out.
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie) media would go wild.
The name panels are so one sided almost all against Trump. name is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!.
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted no energy left!.
Today proves what I have always known that name Priebus is the tough one and the smart one not Debbie Wasserman Shultz name.
Sorry folks but Bernie Sanders is exhausted just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SD!.
There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figurewants it all to end!.

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work..
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses..
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!.
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!.
Wow just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERTION!.
