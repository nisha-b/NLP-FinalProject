negative	don't even bother watching this piece of crap . watch the trailer instead it reveals the entire plot . you'll save a couple hours of your life .
negative	considering great performances by witherspoon and bergan , the film is possibly one of the worst romantic comedies of all time . mcconahay ( i can't spell his name . . lol ) is the perfect contender for the next white trash , smelly role on the big screen . i hated this film , and i hope you will too . ta-ta !
negative	this movie sucked . keanu , stick to the matrix , make a matrix ii please !
negative	i agree 100 % ! ! ! gene hackman couldn't even help this movie .
negative	keanu sucks but so does the movie . you'd think gene hackman would make the movie , but he doesn't . they have cut so many scenes out of the movie that the story doesn't flow naturally . very poor movie .
negative	pitiful .
negative	so stupid and juvenile this film is ! i can't believe that this was based on shakespeare ! this movie was too cheesy for me to withstand ! ( and i usually like bad b-grade movies too ! )
negative	martha , you have to keep old fido in the house . he dragged in another stinky polecat again !
negative	one of the five worst movies ever produced for a large audience . and there is nothing worse than having to watch it with a pack of females who think it is romantic and charming . it isn't . it is contrived to the nth degree and desperately trying to be quirky and loveable . good for people trying to diet because this film will make it difficult for the viewer to keep his food down . on a par with superman iii .
negative	long and boring . i can't even remember the storyline now . it was that boring
negative	it's sad really . . . people watch that ? it had no real amusing points . . . but my sides to hurt from laughing at the crappy acting . . . hue grant needs a better job
negative	it's not the worst movie i've ever seen , cause that was the norwegian film dis , but i'm quite sure it's the worst 1999-film probably the worst comedy in the 90ies ! if there was an oscar for worst actress , julia roberts would certainly get it ! in 1990ies we aren't satisfied with voiceless boring movies with no action ! : - (
negative	what a bore fest this was it was not funny , it wasn't any thing . it just went on and on and was totally pointless . avoid at all costs .
negative	my significant other insisted this was a movie for me -- the reviews he had read were spectacular . he was wrong and so were those reviewers . i cannot recall much about this long drawn out tale other than i should have gotten the largest popcorn they sold -- the meal would have made the experience a bit shy of a big waste of time .
negative	the acting was ok . the accents were very annoying . the swearing was unnecesary . and the woodchipper part was just plain old nasty . save yourself the time and money and don't watch this film
negative	adam sandler sucks !
negative	yet another stupid adam sandler movie with lowbrow humor , profanity and no laughs whatsoever . adam sandler , you are under arrest for making a bad movie . henry winkler , you can go , we understand .
negative	the only funny scenes were in the trailer .
negative	this is the worst movie i've ever seen .
negative	sometimes even the funniest actor can mess up with a movie , and the waterboy proves this . adam sandler plays a waterboy . bored yet ? his mother cuts fish . yet ? his girlfriend dumped him and came back . yet ? his coach is henry winkler . yet ?
negative	one of the worst flicks ever made ! ! i suppose on some low , low , low level this might have been amusing to a few , but to me it blew . hard ! watching a movie where half of the time nothing happens and the other half of the time . . . nothing happens ! ! the plot was nowhere to be found , the acting so poor that you could throw up ( except for steve buscemi and peter stormare ) and an unseemingly desire to believe that all scandinavians start and end their sentences with ja , ja , ja or nej , nej , nej . let me tell you , i live in sweden and watching someone mispronounce our language for over an hour is not my idea of a good time .
negative	adam sandler really goes over the top , sending a message to the audience of careless child care . it runs really slow at times .
negative	this is one of the most embarassingly dumb movies i'd seen in a long time . and i even like adam sandler !
negative	how could a guy who was so funny in happy gilmore be so incredibly lame in waterboy ? i can't believe i spent $ 7 to see this crap . truly awful .
negative	total let down ! it stunk .
negative	dry and boring .
negative	worst movie to be produced in a long , long time . just plain stupid .
negative	dull , predictable , and insufferably stupid .
negative	of all the comments made about violence in the movies today nurse betty has one of the most violent ( and unnessacary ) scenes i have ever witnessed . it was so bad that it totally ruined the rest of the movie . this is no comedy ! ! ! that aside nurse betty quicky put me to sleep for the rest of the movie . to bad , this should have been a great movie . it has a lot of fine actors ( i love morgan freeman ) and what should have been a very good story . however , one scene , one little moment , ruines the experience .
negative	i've walked out of only two movies in my life , and one was nurse betty ( the other was endless love , to give you some perspective ) . i went in expecting a light , entertaining comedy , and what i saw instead was graphic violence and really terrible acting . the movie is about a waitress who witnesses a serious crime , has a break with reality , and then believes she's an actress in her favorite soap opera . with a plot like that , i felt sure i was in for lots of laughs . what a shock it was to see the serious crime depicted in a very realistic , horrifying way and more violence ( including lots of blood and gore ) in subsequent scenes . morgan freeman and chris rock , playing the killers after nurse betty , should be ashamed of themselves . their roles were definitely beneath them , and one of the worst parts was that no one in the theater laughed at any of their jokes . it was pathetic ! i still feel disturbed by the violence i saw in the first hour of the movie . you have been warned !
negative	my friends said this was the funniest movie ever . i watched it and had no clue what they were talking about . it had an extremley dissapointing ending , such bad humor , and some bad acting by good actors .
negative	worst remake ever
negative	yuck ! ! ! ! i hated this movie ! ! it wasn't funny at all . it was horrible . this movie is extremely over-rated . not appealing at all .
negative	although i've never seen the full movie , and some people will criticize me for making a comment , i've seen the previews and heard about it . lets think , they are making the devil look like some sexy woman . that is absolutely disgusting . i wouldn't want to watch a movie like that . for a start , the devil is far from attractive . like charmed , these producers have made the dark side look attractive . you want to know what the real devil is like , well for a start he is the ugliest monster in existance , secondly he hates all of humanity's guts ( and that's biblical fact ) . he was a murderer and lier from the beginning . yeah , it may seem cool having this beautiful woman make the devil look beautiful , but if anyone were to really give their soul to the devil for some sensual pleasures , they will pay for it in a big way , for eternity too . it is not worth risking your whole eternity over , just to get a bit of pleasure on this earth . you want to know why the devil tries to tempt people , because he thinks everyone is stupid enough to fall for it . because in reality , you have two choices . you can keep $ 1 and pay a trillion dollars ( have your earthly pleasures and not be accepted into god's kingdom ) , or you can pay $ 1 now , which will hurt , but get $ 1 trillion dollars back ( give your life over to the lord jesus ) . what one would you choose . judging by that movie , i know what the devil would want you to choose ( keep the dollar , loose the trillion ) . this is not to push my beliefs or to frighten or offend anyone , these are just my thoughts on this movie . plus it seems people arn't judging this movie on it's content or it's morality message ( which is terrible ) , they are judging this movie based on lust ( because they think the woman was attractive ) .
negative	awful ! this movie is lame ! ! !
negative	this movie was horrible ! no purpose whatsoever , gruesome scenes , and just horrible situations . i can't believe people actually think of such things . walked away from the movie with nothing and don't care ever recall it again .
negative	god only knows what harold ramis was thinking . . . . .
negative	it had canadian actors and script , which no one likes . the plot was terrible , yet predictable .
negative	just a really ignornat , mindless romp ! will ferrell running around naked was embarassing .
negative	this movie was about as intelligent as a rock , and almost as boring as one , too ! i was horrified to see vince vaughn lower his standards and star in such filth . pathetic !
negative	wretched , unfunny tripe aimed at career dumbasses .
negative	tediously unfunny scattershot comedy is a gross-out fest wasting all three of it's main actors . a bad rip-off of animal house with no merit .
negative	pretty brutal . i found myself braindead and tired on a sunday night , and taxi with jimmy fallon and queen latifah was on cable . and i watched it . awful storyline , cutesie dialogue , tons of cliches - very painful to watch . not recommended .
negative	painfull ! ! !
negative	a retarted piece of crap .
negative	this movie was gay
negative	witness , my friends , the crude of the crude : i can see this movie being used by women for evidence to kick guys off of the planet forever . at least , they should kick off mindless fools like the actors and writers of this numbingly-idiotic motion picture . in what has to be a record of some sort , over 200 ( yes , you read it right , my friends , two hundred ) uses of the f-word can be cataloged . that's in addition to over 150 other crude words . this makes you wonder if there could actually be any real dialogue . of course , there is none . crude and explicit sexual content is so crass and rampant that i can't get into it on this honorable public opinion forum . drug use rivals the moronic cheech chong movies . acting is bad , and i mean baaaaaddddd ! of course , george carlin makes an appearance , so it is automatically bad . they've even got kids cussing in this movie ! no child actor should be forced into a movie like this one ! the list of crimes in this brain-dead movie goes on : its sexist , it has inappropriate music , there is imitative behavior that kids shouldn't replicate , graphic violence and disrespectful attitudes towards women and policemen . this movie is one of the worst movies of all time , that is for sure . avoid this terror at all costs . just go rent something nice and family-friendly , read a book , play a nintendo game or write a story of your own . but , whatever you do , pay this waste of film no heed .
negative	such a stupid movie . . . . geesh
negative	spare me .
negative	it is on my list of ten worst movies i've ever saw ( or in this case slept through ) . it had all the suspense of a half-hearted game of clue jr . , the story was meandering and wearisome , and the sound quality of the dvd , coupled with the bad british accents made most of the movie sound mushy and inaudible . it was so painfully boring that we rented it for a whole week and popped it in our dvd player 4 nights and fell in and out of repose all week . by the time i woke up for the ending where they reveal whodunit , i commented , i don't even know who they f--k got killed , and angrilly went back to sleep . i don't dig robert ( i hate america ) altman movies . i don't understand why every big-time actor has to make an appearance in an altman movie . must be some coastal elite blue states liberal thing .
negative	for me , it was a 1 . bad , real bad . gosford park is too long . it's a british period piece wrapped up in a murder mystery . 10 of us went to see it . # walked out , 3 fell asleep , 3 figured it out , and 1 didn't care . but , if you're into the brits and you really care about the charmed lives of british nobility , and you can tolerate a long movie where very little happens , then go see it . on second thought , . . .
negative	this movie was sooo stupid ! i dont like martin shean . this movie was nasty .
negative	lets be serious here .
negative	this series should have ended before it even began !
negative	jack nicholson fans beware . this is a waste of money .
negative	this was a comedy , thats news to me because i found no humor in it what so ever . its typical will farrel fare a lot flailing about and badly delivered dialog . don't waste your money renting the dvd its just no worth it .
negative	a totally unappealing , rotten comedy that lacks heart--and mind . the isolated moments of wit ( such as the " when in rome . . . " confusion ) are drowned-out in the all-too-typical stupidity associated with most snl alums . the raunch factor is quite high for a pg-13 movie ( including one particular sight gag that was completely unfunny ) and there is not a single likable character in the entire movie . it competely lost me when the kicked the dog off of the bridge . mean-spirited , uncreative , and mindless--anchorman needs to be cancelled from the realm of cinema altogether .
negative	awful
negative	i get to watch movies for free , and apparently you get what you pay for with this one . along with around the world in 80 days and gods and generals , this is one of the worst movies i've seen in the last several years . it's just further proof that snl alumni are almost incapable of making good movies anymore .
negative	a dumb-ass movie , appealing to dumb-asses . about as funny as a rubber crutch .
negative	this was one of thee worst movies i had ever seen . i normally like will ferell but this was inane and utterly unfunny . it was not offensive in the usual hollywood sense of too much violence and sex but it i was offended that they tried to pass this off as comedy . . do not wast your time or money
negative	worst movie ever . take me back to old school ! ! ! pleeeeeeeeease !
negative	without a doubt the biggest piece of junk to come out of hollywood so far this year . complete garbage all the way . will ferrel's horrendous acting never ceases to amaze me , he just gets worse and worse every movie he comes out with , and this movie is no different than all the other trash he has accomplished thus far . the storyline was loosely based on women's rights in television news . christina applegate barely tried in this movie , but i can understand why . ( i wouldn't do very good acting next to will ferrel either . ) she must have owed someone a favor , otherwise i would never be able to understand why she would even be willing to star in such a piece of junk . do not waste your time or money . . . it is really awful . . .
negative	what about him ?
negative	vomitous nonsense .
negative	drew , you were probably taking tongue kisses when you were 12 .
negative	atrocious .
negative	i would probably like this movie if i didn't have a penis .
negative	this movie was terrible and very disappointing .
positive	this movie is not just good as a teen comedy , it is a great movie ! it's so funny , and alicia silverstone is perfect as the rich beverly hills girl . a classic movie , i'll always watch it if it's on tv .
positive	i have been obsessed with this movie since it came out when i was in 7th grade . it took me 20 times watching it to figure out the hip lingo and i even counted cher's outfits : 42 !
positive	this was a great flick . it's okay to be ditzy , especially when it's funny
positive	this is my all time favortie movie . it is hilarious and upbeat , and even though she seems ditzy , we can all relate to cher's problems .
positive	good comedy for teenagers . really cute movie about sex and teenagers .
positive	i don't ordinarily think of this as a great movie , but it is one that -- when you click by and see it on tv -- i always want to watch . the script is really memorable , the storyline is oddly sweet , and the characters are pulled off convincingly .
positive	love it ! uh . . . . i can't play tennis , coach , because my plastic surgeon tells me i shouldn't have balls flying at my face . there goes her social life . ha !
positive	this is great ! i was blown away the first time i saw it , it's hilarious , sad , everything . peter sellers is absolutely wonderful as chance , and being there is just a great movie . i loved the atmosphere , and i don't think i can find much wrong with it . you should see it if you're a movie fan . being there is great . summary : hilarious , sad , great . sellers is marvelous .
positive	while i can't enjoy this movie everytime i see it as much as i did the first time i saw it , it still holds a place among the top films of all time . first of all , it has peter sellers in it , who kubrick put into three roles in dr strangelove and who was perhaps the only person capable of outdoing george c scott's work in that film . this is peter sellers from lolita and the pink panther one of the most talented actors comedic or otherwise , ever . he plays a childlike man accidentally raised to the role of brilliant philosopher and presidential economic advisor and public figure through a series of strange , seemingly divinely inspired events that manage to appear funny and charming while simultaneously being insanely unlikely . the movie is full of heart and beauty , while also being bitingly satirical , both of its time and the tv-brainsucker-victims of ours . the film requires complete attention , especially for the delicate sequences at the end , and seller's understated delivery , which at times is so poignant as to be painful . one of the best .
positive	this was a great movie . gene wilders more serious movies , and contains great actimg , and humor . this is one of the better gene wilder movies .
positive	like i said there isnt one movie with johnny depp that i dont like i loved it he was a really funny guy in there and yeah it was great .
positive	john waters is truly one of the best out there in the entertainment industry . this musical of a movie was so cute , i truly enjoyed it . ricki lake also did a great job in this movie . i highly recommend it to john waters fans and musical fans alike .
positive	it's probably one of the only musicals i actually like . it stars johnny depp as a very angry self-confessed juvenile delinquent with his friends milton , wanda , and milton's girlfriend hatchet-face . then they befriend an uptight prudish girl named allison vernon williams ( amy locane ) . their lifestyles collide and lots of hysteria and chaos unravels .
positive	it's been rather difficult of late doing without any bruce willis die hard movies . realizing of course how john mcclain is pretty much worn out . . . ca-poots-kah . . ! but who can blame the dude , after all those disgusting messes those grueber dudes put him through . ya know what i'm sayin ? those guys had john climbin up elevator shafts and shootin at him then blowin things up all around john . . . and terrible stuff like that . oh well , thanks for the memorys john mcclain you were a shining example of courage in the nypd . . . fer sure dude . perhaps now that john's pretty much exhausted his role as super ny cop . . . well , maybe john can get on as a rent a cop with some late night warehouse in the east side of ny . best movies ever ; those die hard series . yep , no doubt about it . . . fer sure . john was the best .
positive	real great movie its about a girl who wants to find her true dreams well then theres some problems its not just easy squezzy she has a boy who likes her and almost get fired
positive	love this movie !
positive	piper perabo hubba hubba
positive	so adrenalizing yet so humorous . it sure is at the top of my list for action films .
positive	ok folks , it's not going to win an oscar and it's not going to be shown at the cannes film festival , but it is a great movie . piper perabo , who played the lead character violet has that aww shucks sexy girl next door look that you would either want for your daughter or girlfriend . the music was great and i personally like leann rimes who plays herself in this movie and does the actual singing . i like movies for their entertainment value . i want to sit down , relax and be entertained and this movie does that for me .
positive	okay , so it's corny and cliche'd but it's also a lot of fun . i really like it 'cause it's got that feel good factor about it . the soundtrack is good too , and it's ending is pure cheese fantastic ! ! !
positive	i loved this movie . i think it was great that she followed her dreams . it tells a great story . it one of the best movies ever .
positive	very entertaining . the sound track carried the movie . the characters were believable and fun to watch . what everyone who has never been to new york hopes it is really like . john goodman as the father was a great addition .
positive	at first , i thought it would be a retarded movie , until my friends showed it to me . i thought coyote ugly wold mainly be about strippers or some thing , but i was wrong . it was an excellent movie that i can even show to my mom .
positive	this was so much fun !
positive	i loved it ! ! ! i want to be a coyoty ugly for life ! ! ! the music was awesome and i used to be a dancer so i couldn't sit still . i love the music and i love how it made women feel like they rule ! ! !
positive	i didnt think coyote ugly was going to be all that great . boy was i wrong ! the plot was definetley more than i thought , the music was great , and i really got into the movie !
positive	coyote ugly was a wonderful movie , i think it really gives you inspiration . no matter how many times you watch it , it always bring a smile to my face .
positive	coyote ugly is my favorite movie . the girls were great especially piper perabo . i love her so much . i would do anything to meet her . she is the most amazing , beautiful woman i have ever seen .
positive	great movie . true , there are implausibilities ; who was where when sgt . al first radioed for help ? but there was great effort to tie different parts of the movie together ; much of the movie is foreshadowed on the airplane ; bruce willis is a soon to be barefoot cop .
positive	coyote ugly was a fantastic movie ! i love the story line and the cast ! it made me want to get up and become a coyote . two thumbs up ! great movie !
positive	i thought that coyote ugly was a great movie ! ! ! makes you believe that if you put your mind to it , you can make your dreams come true . i'm in the business and would love to own a bar like that . the music also stays with you , you'll be singing it for days , until you finally buy the c . d .
positive	coyote ugly was one of the best movies ever ! granted , speaking as a guy , i don't really have much bias given the girls , but at least it had a plot , and i'm thankful for that . my suggestion to you is if you like attractive women , and romantic comedies . . . i would definitely see this movie !
positive	very predictable storyline and plot , but it was still a very good movie . great line dancing in the movie . it had a good enough ending .
positive	this movie was a very fun movie . i think the storyline was very cute , it kind of made you think of what / who you really want to be in life , or what path you want to take .
positive	another great movie that i didn't mind paying eight dollars to watch . this was a total chick flick . i went to see it with my sister and i enjoyed it so much that i was talking about it for hours afterwards .
positive	it was a better movie than i thought it would be . it is a chick and dude movie because of the girls and the sentiment .
positive	the greatest ordinary superhero of all time fights terrorists and beats them starting with one gun and no shoes .
positive	good , sexy movie . i like the music and the cast of characters . started out slow , but good finale .
positive	this was a good movie about how some women get paid for doing a job as a bartender . there is a good plot for her singing career . she never gave up .
positive	i liked this movie because it has hot girls dancing in it . i think it appeals to many guys . there is also a theme to the movie to follow your dreams , which is pretty cool since it will attract the girls . something for everyone .
positive	emotional , sexy and funny- all elements of a good movie .
positive	a great adrenaline rush , a real guy movie with buildings blowing up left and right . die hard two and three are not as good as the original . bruce willis was the man in the movie .
positive	this movie was great ! it showed how girls can do something all on their own and make a difference without needing help from anyone else . i loved the music and the storyline , awesome !
positive	i thought this movie was really good . it left me in a feel good mood . it was very interesting . there hasn't been any movies out lately about a singer .
positive	when i went to go see coyote ugly i just thought that it was going to be about the bar . but it was really about one girl who worked in the bar and her struggle to be a songwriter , which made it that much more interesting . all of the jokes and plot twists kept your attention and emotions one the edge of your seat .
positive	this is a wonderful and excellent movie ! ! ! ! !
positive	the storyline was great and i feel it pleased both the male and female crowds . i really liked it .
positive	i loved this movie because of the fun adventure that this young girl goes through . the cast is fun and i liked it because they made it so believeable . this movie made the audience want to go be a bartender ( and go buy the soundtrack ) .
positive	that is the best movie if you like singing dancing and boot kicking this is your movie ! ! ! ! oh and by the way don't liten to people 2 stars and lower the movie is great , but take any advice you want .
positive	i loved this movie ! it was a good chick flick that i would go to even with guys . my boyfriend liked it because of the hot chicks dancing on the bar and drinking all that alcohol .
positive	a great action movie . lots of great one-liners , cool explosions , and a good plot . bruce willis is the man .
positive	movie has girls . guy flick . attractive girls . good plot .
positive	i loved this movie ! it was just a really fun movie ! ( not to mention adam garcia ! ) the music was awesome and i found myself singing 'can't fight the moon light' for weeks . 5 stars .
positive	this movie is really good . it shows that girls can have a good time while running a bar . me and my friends related to the characters in the movie .
positive	an explosive terrorist movie . the first of it's kind . i found this movie to be extremely well done and bruce willis was outstanding .
positive	black women in all-white neighborhoods are funny .
positive	the fighting scenes aren't so fake like in those steven segal movies . the only movie that i like of his .
positive	this is probably the first comedy i have seen in theatres this year that was actually worth watching . it was great ! i laughed all the way thru this one . queen latifah is exactly as she is called in this movie . . she is the one and only cocoa goddess . she definately stood out in this movie ! as for steve martin , i never loved him or anything , and he is definately showing his age in this one . but regardless , the movie was hilarious and i can't wait to buy it on dvd .
positive	i have seen this movie 4 times in theatres all ready- and mr . good dosent know what hes talking about- this is one of the funniest films i have seen in a long time . great film
positive	very funny ! enjoyed every minute of it .
positive	offensive , but hilariously funny comedy . steve martin plays a divorced lawyer who's life is pretty dull . his life revolves around his two children , and he gets little free time . that is until charlene , played by queen latifah comes into his life . she wants him to help her call out her true innocence , and find the person who committed the crime for which she is charged for . and with a hilarius supporting cast of betty white , jean smart , and eugene levy . . . you can't get any better .
positive	great movie , with some hysterical moments . jim carrey is great in this movie . i'd recommend you skip the sequel though .
positive	this movie established jim carrey as one of the most hilarious and goofy guys of all time . this movie got me hooked on jim carrey and i remember all the kids trying to impersonate his craziness .
positive	what are you talking about lukskywlkr ? this was the funniest movie i have ever witnessed ! i guess you don't have a sense of humor anyone agree ?
positive	this has got to be the funniest movie out there . jim carrey his fabulous ! what the heck is it doing all the way down at 127 ? ? ?
positive	i think this is a great movie . i have seen this so many times i know it word for word through the whole movie and i can do the fast-talking sequence ( what you wouldn't read about is how ray finkle lost his mind was committed to a mental hospital only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hiker manipulating his way to the top in a diabolical scheme to get even with dan marino who he blamed for the entire thing ) faster than jim carrey in the movie and yet i still laugh at the jokes . my favourite part is when ace turns up at ray finkles house and says hi , i'm looking for ray finkle then a shotgun is pointed to is head . he replies and a clean pair of shorts . and when asked over the phone by courtney cox where he is , he says i'm in phsychoville and finkle's the mayor . all in all one of carreys best performances . the sequel was crap .
positive	die hard was a good movie . the actors were good . they storyline was great , how he had to save the building .
positive	this movie does get annoying but it makes up with all the lauphs . jim carry is a great actor . any charecter yoou give him , he'll make it work .
positive	perfectly wild physical comedy from the master himself . a fun movie and a classic of it's kind .
positive	i love this movie even though i am not a big fan of jim carey . this movie is sooooo funny ! i have seen it a lot with my best friend but , we still crack up through most of the movie .
