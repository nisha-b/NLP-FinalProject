Thank you, God Bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America.
Let us answer the call of history, and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time.
You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country‚Äôs course.
We must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate.
Decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay.
Our journey is not complete until all our children know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm.
Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity.
Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote.
Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.
Our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.
We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths‚Äîthat all of us are created equal‚Äîis the star that guides us still.
We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully.
We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.
We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.
We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.
We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.
We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
We, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.
We are made for this moment, and we will seize it‚Äîso long as we seize it together. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
America‚Äôs possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
We have always understood that when times change, so must we. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable, and protect its people from life‚Äôs worst hazards and misfortune.
We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
Each time we gather to inaugurate a president, we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution. ‚ÄîPresident Obama
